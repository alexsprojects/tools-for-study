## Welcome!

Welcome to my repo for things I have found or things I have made to support your learning and my own.
The repo might not have anything in it yet, that's ok, just bear with me.
If a resource I find is code-based, you will find a link to the repo it is hosted on  in the README.md and the code inside the 'Code' folder in this repo.
If a resource I find is website-based, you'll find the link in the README.md . If you happen to be reading this on my website, assignment.tools, please view this on GitHub instead. A link is at **the top of the site**. A mega-list of programs that **are not open-source** but are great is in it's own folder on GitHub, called 'MEGALIST'. It's not made by me, credit is given in the file. I will be making my own programs on here from now own, however I will keep all the old ones I've uploaded from others.

## Websites

1. scholar.google.com
  Google Scholar is a website where you can find thousands of creditable academic papers. However, always cross-check your findings.

## Programs and Tools

A quick heads-up for programs and tools: you will need a few prerequisites. The one thing you will **need** for every single code-based project on here is **Visual Studio**. Really most IDEs would be fine, however I recommend you use Visual Studio as it is what I have used to test/modify these programs. I will always credit the original creator. If you have no expierience in the field of code, you can see a tutorial on how to run the programs at the bottom of the README.md . (The README is what you're looking at now.)

1. If you have smart lights, this **Python** script is for you.
  Code is in CODE branch I beleive and a link to the OG is here https://github.com/KpaBap/hue-flux .

## Hey, I need Visual Studio for all the code programs. How do I get it and run the tools?

First of all, and I can not stress this enough, **FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL WORD FOR WORD.** If a program does not work, it is because you have not followed the correct instructions (among other things).

1. **Download Microsoft Visual Studio Community.** It's free.
2. **I recommend signing in to a Microsoft account and installing all the frameworks and suport such as .NET (for C# programs) and Python.** You don't have to, however. Everything you might need to install will be mentioned in the file containing the code.
3. **Copy and paste the code from the repo into a new solution/project.** Ensure you are using the correct settings for the code I have provided. 
4. **Save the solution.** File > Save All
5. **Press Run.** You'll find it at the top of the screen.
6. **The program should run.** If there are any compiling errors or syntax errors or **anything annoying like that**, feel free to contact me or comment in the repo.

## **IMPORTANT: FOR MOST PROGRAMS, I WILL LINK A VISUAL STUDIO SOLUTION I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU. THIS TUTORIAL IS ONLY FOR THe ONES WHERE I HAVE FORGOTTEN OR COULD NOT CREATE ONE.**
